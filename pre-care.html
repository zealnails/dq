    <h2>MICROBLADING PRE-CARE</h2>
      <div class="third2"style="line-height:2;">
      Are you ready to have a perfect eyebrow? Here’s a list of things to prepare yourself for your appointment:
    <ul>Do not book your Microblading appointment within days before a special event. You will require a few days of downtime following your initial appointment. Review our aftercare page for detailed.
    Please refrain from all activities that may cause irritation of the skin or thinning of the blood prior to your appointment:
    <li>	No coffee or alcohol or energy drink 24 hours before receiving Microblading</li>
    <li>No all medications that cause blood thinning such as Aspirin, Niacin, Vitamin E, Ibuprofen, fish oil 48 hours before receiving Microblading. (Please consult your physician before stopping any medication).</li>
    <li>No eyebrows waxing 2-3 days before treatment.</li>
    <li>No suntanning, microdermabrasion, derma planning, laser treatment, chemical peels 7-10 days before receiving Microblading.</li>
    <li>No any and all Retin-A or Retinol products for a minimum of 7 days prior to your appointment and 30 days post appointment. These products can cause premature and extreme color loss. If you decide to continue your Retin-A or Retinol use do not apply on the treated area and please keep in mind that our artists are responsible for the loss of color in your cosmetic tattoo.</li>
    <li>If you are experiencing any blemished, acne, cold sores, any other skin irritation, or have a mole, scars in or around the area of procedure please contact our artists via email zealnails@gmail.com for a consultation. Failure to communicate any of these may result in a cancellation or rescheduling of your appointment. All deposits are nonrefundable.</li>
    <li>If you receive Botox, filler on forehead, temple, and eye area please ensure you leave 2-3 weeks in between session to ensure it doesn’t affect the overall symmetry of your new cosmetic tattoo.</li>
    <li>Please ensure you come to the appointment well hydrated and well fed. The process will take several hours.</li>

    </ul>

        <h2> TAKE CARE OF YOUR EYEBROWS AFTER TREATMENT</h2>

          <ul> The best results come from the “Do nothing” or “Dry healing” method. The absolute best result come from keeping your brows extremely DRY for the next 10 days. By keeping them dry makes them retain more detail, better color and more crisp strokes.  It sounds tricky but can be done if you’re mindful of it.  Here’s how:
          <li>	Within 30 mins after the procedure wash the eyebrows with neutral soap, remove all the lymph and previous applied cream by doing so, after that apply a very thin layer of the giving cream.</li>
          <li>Repeat this in every 3 hours during the day. If the treatment was done late in the afternoon and you do not have time to do it 3 to 5 times, put a plastic foil over the eyebrows you previously applied the cream on, so that you protect the eyebrows from drying and wiping overnight.</li>
          <li>Keep your face directly out of the shower stream and do your best to carefully wash hair and keep face as dry as possible. Keep clean, dry paper towel on hand to pat dry if they accidentally get moist. Also keep showers brief, as too much steam can harm brows as well.</li>
          <li>When washing your face, be sure not to splash water onto your face like we normally do. Instead use a washcloth or disposable cleansing wipe to wash around the brows.</li>
          <li>Use product free blotting paper 3 times a day for normal skin, and 6 times a day for oily skin directly on top of the brows and then the surrounding area for the first 10 days as well.</li>
          <li>If your skin starts to feel tight or dry around day 7, you can use small amount of coconut oil or lavender essential oil (suggest)</li>
          <li>If your brows start scabbing, please let it fall off by itself. It may leave some scars if you help.</li>
</ul>
          <ul>DURING THE FIRST 7 DAY:
          <li>AVOID all cream (except for protection cream)</li>
          <li>AVOID applying makeup (foundation) to the eyebrow region.</li>
          <li>AVOID workouts that involve excessive perspiration, saunas, facial massage and steaming (inhalation)</li>
</ul>
          <ul>IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS:
          <li>AVOID sunbathing, tanning beds, light therapy, chemical peels, fruit acids, microdermabrasion, cream that contain regeneration factors.</li>
          <li>Avoid laser treatment over the treat area because they may destroy the pigment and cause burning. Use of antibiotics and hormonal therapy can lead to faster pigment fading.</li>
<li>Always protect the eyebrows from the sun using a SPF (NOT IN THE FIRST 7 DAYS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>EYELINER AFTERCARE</h2>
It is highly recommended to follow our instructions to ensure the best possible result. This information acts as a guideline only. We cant guarantee results. Each client's skin responds differently both in how long it take to heal and number of sessions needed for color retention and desired results.

<h3>WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER PERMANENT EYELINER:</h3>
<ul>

<li>DAY 1-2:  The color is maybe 30% darker than it will be. It also will be slightly larger in few days. It s unlikely that anyone will notice you 've had your eyeliner done except for possible those you know very well.</li>

<li>DAY 3-4: You may wake up slightly puffy, eyeliner will feel tight and dry, but not painful. ( It will appearance as you have been crying).Swelling, redness , itching is normal since the skin is very thin in this area. Placing a spoons in your fridge then placing it on the eyelid will help speed up the process.</li>

<li>DAY 5-7:  Your eyeliner will begin flaking until there is no scabbing left. You want to allow healing to shed naturally. Blinking will help. It is important NOT TO PICK OR RUB THE EYE. Once all scabbing has finished , your eyeliner color will look lighter. It is temporary as your freshly healed skin is hidding the true color. Over the next several weeks your eyeliner color will bloom. Just be patience.</li>

<li>DAY 42:  At 6 weeks your eyeliner is fully healed. Now it is okay for you to come back in for any adjustment such as darkening color or altering the shape.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>	After the procedure, gently blot the area with a clean tissue to absorb excess lymph fluid.</li>
<li>	Do this every 5 minutes until the oozing has stopped.</li>
<li>Removing this fluid prevents hardening of the lymphatic fluids.</li>
<li>	Wash daily to remove bacteria, build up of product and oils, and dead skin. (Don't worry, THIS DOES NOT REMOVE THE PIGMENT!)</li>
<li>	Gently wash the area each morning and night with water and gentle soap or an unscented cleanser like Dial Soap, Cetaphil, or baby shampoo.  With a very light touch, use your clean fingertips to gently cleanse the area.</li>
<li>	Rub the area in a smooth motion for 10 seconds and rinse with water ensuring that all soap is rinsed away.</li>
<li>	To dry, gently pat with a clean tissue. DO NOT use any cleansing products containing acids (glycolic, lactic, or AHA), or exfoliants.</li>
<li>	Apply a tiny, rice grain amount of the given ointment 2  times a day with a cotton swab and spread it across the treated area.</li>
<li>	Be sure not to over-apply, as this will suffocate your skin and delay healing. The product should be barely noticeable on the skin.</li>
<li>	NEVER put the product on a wet or damp tattoo.</li>
</ul>
