      <!-- <h2 class="top">FAQ ABOUT SEMI PERMANENT MAKEUP</h2> -->
      
      <div class="third2">
        <h3>WHAT IS SEMI PERMANENT MAKEUP</h3>

Semi-Permanent makeup is commonly referred to as a “cosmetic tattoo”, but it’s not a traditional tattoo at all, nor is it really “permanent”. Tiny amounts of natural pigments are inserted into the dermal layer of the skin, not the epidermis (where a regular tattoo goes). Because of that, results will last a long time, but will eventually fade in approximately 1-3 years. This is perfect since faces and trends change!

      </div>
    <div class="third2">

    <h3>HOW WILL I LOOK AFTER MY SESSION?</h3>
Your new color will look darker and more defined the first week. After about a week, the color’s intensity will soften about 40% and settle in. Detailed aftercare instructions are provided and reviewed before and after each procedure.
</div>
      <div class="third2">
        <h3>HOW LONG DOES THE RESULT LAST?</h3>
      Permanent makeup is long-lasting and will slowly fade over 1-3 years. To keep your makeup looking fresh, we recommend having it retouched every year. Darker colors, such as black eyeliner, will last the longest. Natural, delicate colors are more vulnerable to the effects of sun, swimming and your skin’s natural emollients.For brows, up to 3 years. For lips, one to two years. For eyeliner, three to five years.
</div>
      <div class="third2">
      <h3>  IS IT PAINFUL?</h3>
    It is my goal to make your experience as pain-free as possible! I use effective topical anesthetic ointments that numbs the skin, and I am happy to apply as much as needed to keep you comfortable. Everyone experiences pain differently, but most of our clients say the pain is mild to moderate, comparable to eyebrow tweezing. We even see clients that are terrified at first and have no problem with my application.
    </div>
      <div class="third2">
      <h3>IS IT SAFE?</h3>

Absolutely!
All pigments are cosmetic grade, meaning that they are sterilized and purified for cosmetic use. At Zeal Nails & Microblading, I use PhiBrows pigments contain: 0% Lead, 0% Cadmium, 0% Nickel, 0% Mercury, 0% Cobolt, 0% Tartrazine; are high quality pigments which are made in Germany.
In addition, all my tools are single-use and discarded after the treatment.
All our pigments are cosmetic grade, meaning that they are sterilized and purified for cosmetic use. The ingredients used have been approved by the FDA for cosmetic use. Be wary of products that have not met safety standards, including those that contain “vegetable dyes” that are unstable and may change color after time. In addition, all our tools are single-use and discarded after the treatment. Our specialists are highly trained and experienced professionals.

      <div class="third2">
      <h3>WHO IS THE IDEAL CANIDIDATE FOR SEMI PERMANENT MAKEUP ?</h3>

  Permanent makeup is perfect for busy women and men who are looking to save time and want their look to stay perfect around the clock. People who have light, half eyebrows or eyebrows with bald spots love our microblading brow service. People with eyes sensitive to makeup or sparse lashes love permanent eyeliner, and those who want fuller looking, more defined lips love lip tinting.

  Permanent makeup is also a great solution for those with oily skin that shed makeup easily, athletes, swimmers and beach goers who want to sweat and get wet without their makeup running, and anyone wanting to boost their confidence!
  </div>
  <div class="third2">
    <h3>HOW LONG IS THE PROCEDURES?</h3>

Time will vary with each individual and area being covered and whether it’s your first time or you’re coming in for a touch-up. It takes an average of 1-3hours for each procedure. The total time to expect at our salon for your first session (including consultation, color selection, and application) is about three hours.

  </div>
  <div class="third2">
    <h3>WHAT IS RECOVERY TIME?</h3>

There’s no downtime; you can go back to work right after your brows, eyeliner or lip procedure. It’s normal to have some swelling on the lip and eye, and/or some minor scabbing on eyebrows. Your color will initially look 20-30% bolder than what the final result will be, after about a week when it settles in. It will take about 7 days for the skin to completely heal. Our clients generally say they walk out ready to take on the rest of their day with no discomfort. Get more details on eyebrow, eyeliner and lip tinting aftercare instructions.

  </div>
  <div class="third2">

  <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT AT MY FIRST APPOINTMENT?</h3>
I will apply numbing cream, while you fill out your paperwork. I will be happy to answer any your questions. I will draw in and define the areas to be colored and work with you on shape, thickness and color. After that I’ll do my magic! When you’re done, you’ll receive cream, a wipe clean, an aftercare instruction, and set up appointment for your 6 weeks touchup (your option) before heading out the door with your fabulous look.
Note: Although we’ve seen excellent results in a single session, it is best to come in with a mindset that multiple sessions are sometimes required to achieve optimal results. Touch ups give us an opportunity to see how your skin heals, review pigment retention, and make any necessary adjustment.
</div>
<div class="third2">

<h3>HOW IS MY COLOR CHOSEN?</h3>

I will custom blend a color for you, usually base on your hair and your real brows color. However, the final decision is always yours, and you’ll see your color before it’s applied.
</div>
<div class="third2">
  <h3>DOES MICROBLADING DAMAGE THE BROW HAIR?</h3>
  No, in fact some clients with sparse natural eyebrows report their hair grows back even better after having permanent makeup applied.
</div>
      <div class="third2">
      <h3>HOW MANY SESSIONS DO I NEED FOR A NEW SET OF MICROBLADED EYEBROWS?</h3>
      A new set of Microbladed eyebrows takes two appointments to complete. The technique and art of microblading is very delicate and for this reason it needs two visits to ensure that all the strokes are evenly saturated with pigment. The second appointment is called a complementary touchup and takes place 6 to 8 weeks after the initial appointment after the pigments settled into the skin. In this complementary touchup, the artist makes any needed adjustments and ensures each hair-stroke has even color.
      </div>
      <div class="third2">
        <h3>CAN I WEAR MAKEUP AFTER THE PROCEDURE?</h3>
It’s essential to keep the procedure area clean and free of bacteria, therefore, you cannot put other types of makeup on top of your permanent makeup for one week after the procedure. However, on areas where permanent makeup was not applied, you can wear what you normally do.

      </div>
      <div class="third2">
      <h3>WHO SHOULD AVOID PERMANENT MAKEUP?</h3>
<ul>For safety reasons, the following should not have permanent makeup applied:
<li>Areas that have had fillers (like Juvederm) should be avoided as well as any areas that have problematic skin conditions like skin cancer, eczema and psoriasis.</li>
<li>Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.</li>
<li>Anyone with contagious blood diseases like Hepatitis or HIV.</li>
<li>People who are currently undergoing chemotherapy.</li>
<li>Those who have keloid or hypopigmentation.</li>
<li>Roaccutane and steroid users. ( THIS IS A STRICT POLICY)</li>
<li>Diabetics (check with your doctor)</li>
</ul>
